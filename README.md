# Presentation

MiniTL is a minimalisting toy model transformation language for [EMF](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) models. It enables the definition of transformations, which consist of rules. A rule specifies how to (simply) transform each object of an input model into a new object.

# Compilation and usage

## Organization of the code



## Compilation

All the projects must be imported in a workspace of the [GEMOC Studio](http://gemoc.org/studio). Then wait for the build to finish.

## Usage

When everything is compiled in the GEMOC Studio, launch a new Eclipse instance, and start playing with the textual editor.

# TODO

- GEMOC execution engine integration (need Melange project)
- Add static semantic (ie. a `Validator`)
- Improve textual syntax
