# Presentation

**MiniTL** is a minimalisting toy model transformation language for [EMF](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) models. It enables the definition of transformations, which consist of rules. A rule specifies how is transformed an input object of an input model into a new output object.

# Compilation and usage

## Organization of the code

Main eclipse plugins:

- `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.model` contains the metamodel of MiniTL, using the Ecore language.
- `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.semantics` contains the operational semantics of MiniTL (ie. the interpreter), using the [Kermeta3](http://diverse-project.github.io/k3/) language.
- `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.xdsml` contains the definition of the language using the [Melange](http://melange.inria.fr/) language.
- `org.tetrabox.example.minitl` contains the *language runtime* generated by Melange, *ie.* a new Ecore model that contains both static elements (from `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.model`) and dynamic features (from `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.semantics`), along with a copy of the semantics that is compatible with this new Ecore model. In other words, once this project has been generated, it is systematically used in place of `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.model` or `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.semantics`.
- `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.tcs` contains the textual concrete syntax of MiniTL, using [Xtext](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/). Please note that this syntax is defined for the generated metamodel that can be found in `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.model`, and not on the original metamodel found in `org.tetrabox.example.minitl.model` (see previous item for explanations).

## Compilation

All the projects must be imported in a workspace of the [GEMOC Studio](http://gemoc.org/studio). Then wait for the build to finish.

## Usage

### Write a transformation

- When everything is compiled in the GEMOC Studio, launch a new Eclipse instance.
- Create an empty project.
- Set the Xtext nature on the project: right click, *Configure*, *Add Xtext nature*.
- Create input and output metamodels using Ecore, in one or two separate `ecore` files.
- Create an input model conforming to the input metamodel, using right click *Create dynamic instance* in the Ecore editor.
- Create a file with the extension `.minitl`.
- Open the file, and use the MiniTL textual editor to write a transformation that relies on the previously created input and output metamodels.

### Configure a transformation run

- Create a new Eclipse run configuration of type *Gemoc Sequential eXecutable Model*
- Fill the fields in this way:
	- Model to execute: the `.minitl` file
	- Model initialization arguments: the first line should be a `platform:/resource` URI pointing to the input model conforming to the input metamodel; the second line shoud be an absolute filesystem path to the output model serialized by the MiniTL transformation.
	- Melange languages: choose MiniTL from the list.
	- Main method: pick the only one in the list.
	- Main model element path: pick the only *Transformation* element in the list.

### Execute the transformation

- Then start the execution TODO

# TODO

- Add static semantic (ie. a `Validator`)
- Improve textual syntax
- See how to feed the GEMOC Studio with a static xtext model, that should be translated into a dynamic version
